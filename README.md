# Uber-Supply-Demand-Gap-Data-Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes the supply-demand gap in Uber ride requests. It examines patterns in ride demand, identifies supply shortages, and provides insights to improve service efficiency.

## Objectives

- Load and clean Uber ride request data.

- Identify patterns in demand and supply gaps.

- Visualize key insights using data analysis techniques.

- Recommend strategies to optimize Uber ride availability.

## Dataset

- The dataset includes:

- Ride request timestamps

- Pickup locations

- Ride status (completed, canceled, or no car available)

- Driver availability

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Sourcing & Cleaning: Load, inspect, and clean the data.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify demand patterns and supply shortages.

3. Data Visualization: Use graphs to understand peak demand and supply deficiencies.

4. Insights & Recommendations: Provide solutions to mitigate demand-supply gaps.

## Technologies Used

- Python

- Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation)

- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)

- Jupyter Notebook (Interactive analysis)

## Results

- Identification of peak demand hours and locations.

- Understanding of supply shortages affecting ride availability.

- Data-driven recommendations to improve Uberâ€™s service efficiency.
